    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div>
      <p>I am a young and passionate pixel addict who was born with a camera in her hand.</p>
      <p>I am passionate about making things <b>more usable and easier to handle</b> ... and as much as I like to work I also like lifting weights and enjoy travelling.</p>
      <p>I am working as a Software Engineer at IBM UK in an agile development environment. Since completing the UX certification with CareerFoundry in 2016, I was able<br>
        to join and lead a couple IBM Design Thinking workshops, working and researching on small projects and attending Design conferences, to stay up to date and network<br>
        with other creative people.</p>
